    "Q1. **What is Web Scraping and Why It's Used:**\n",
    "   - Web scraping is like collecting information from websites. It's used to extract data from web pages automatically. People use web scraping in various areas:\n",
    "     1. **Research**: Gathering data for analysis or research.\n",
    "     2. **E-commerce**: Monitoring prices and product details.\n",
    "     3. **News and Social Media**: Tracking news articles or social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Different Methods for Web Scraping:**\n",
    "   - Web scraping can be done in various ways, including:\n",
    "     1. **Manual Scraping**: Copy-pasting data by hand, which is slow and not practical for large-scale tasks.\n",
    "     2. **Using Libraries**: Writing code to automate data extraction. Libraries like Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Requests are often used.\n",
    "     3. **Using Web Scraping Tools**: Using software tools that provide a user-friendly way to scrape data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **What is Beautiful Soup and Why It's Used:**\n",
    "   - Beautiful Soup is like a web page decoder. It's used to parse HTML and XML documents, making it easier to extract specific information from web pages. You use Beautiful Soup to navigate the structure of a webpage, find elements like headings or links, and extract the data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Why Flask is Used in Web Scraping Project:**\n",
    "   - Flask is like a helper for creating web applications. In a web scraping project, Flask can be used to build a simple web interface to display the scraped data. This makes it easier for users to access and interact with the collected information. Flask helps present the data in a user-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **AWS Services Used in the Project:**\n",
    "   - In a web scraping project hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you might use services like:\n",
    "     1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: It's like a virtual computer where you can run your web scraping scripts.\n",
    "     2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Think of it as a storage space where you can store the scraped data or any other files.\n",
    "     3. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: If you need to store structured data, you can use RDS, which is like a managed database service. It's suitable for more organized data storage."
