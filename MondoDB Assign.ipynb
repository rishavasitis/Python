    "# 1. MongoDB is a type of database that stores data in a way different from traditional SQL databases. \n",
    "In non-relational databases like MongoDB, data is organized in a more flexible, document-based structure,\n",
    "which is especially good for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. \n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases when you need to store and retrieve data that doesn't fit neatly into tables,\n",
    "like JSON documents or other complex data formats.\n",
    "It's also useful when you need to scale horizontally and handle a large amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemaless: MongoDB doesn't require a fixed schema, making it flexible for handling different types of data.\n",
    "High Performance: It can handle large volumes of data and high read/write operations.\n",
    "Replication and High Availability: It supports data replication and automatic failover to ensure data availability.\n",
    "Scalability: It's easy to scale horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased data loads.\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB provides efficient indexing for faster data retrieval.\n",
    "Aggregation: It offers powerful aggregation and query capabilities for data analysis.\n",
    "Geospatial Queries: Supports geospatial data and queries for location-based applications.\n",
    "Security: Provides authentication and authorization features to secure data.\n",

    "# Q3. To connect MongoDB to Python and create a database and collection, you can use the PyMongo library. Here's a code snippet:\n",

    "..Connect to MongoDB (default connection to localhost)\n",

    "Insert one record\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "one_record = mycol.find_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "print(one_record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. The find() method is used to query a MongoDB database. You can specify criteria to filter the data you want to retrieve. Here's a simple code example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "..Query for all records with age greater than 30\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "..Sort records by age in ascending order\n",
    "\n",

    "delete_one(): Used to delete a single document that matches a specified criteria. It's handy when you want to remove a specific record.\n",
    "delete_many(): Deletes multiple documents that meet the specified criteria.\n",
    "Useful for removing multiple records at once.\n",
    "drop(): This method is used to delete an entire collection,\n",
    "effectively removing all documents and the collection itself.\n",
    "It's a more drastic action compared to delete_one() and delete_many()."
