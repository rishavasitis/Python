    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) but serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary implementation details and providing a simplified view of an object or system. It allows us to work with the essential features and behaviors while ignoring the internal complexities. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes, interfaces, or abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In a banking system, a customer interacts with their account using high-level operations like deposit, withdraw, or transfer. The customer does not need to know the intricate details of how these operations are implemented in the backend. The abstraction layer shields the customer from low-level implementation details, providing a simplified interface to work with the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, involves bundling data and related behaviors (methods) within a class and controlling access to them. It aims to keep the internal state of an object hidden and protected from direct external access. Encapsulation provides data integrity and ensures that an object's attributes can only be accessed or modified through predefined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a Person class with attributes like name and age. The class can provide methods like get_name() and set_age() to control access to these attributes. The internal state (attributes) is encapsulated within the class, and the methods act as gatekeepers, allowing controlled access to the data. This prevents direct modification of the attributes without going through the defined methods."
